  "description": "Fork the repo and create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the widget as described in the [Contact List image](https://github.com/14four/skills-assessment/blob/master/contactListUpdated.jpg).  It should take you about 3 hours, but you should try and complete it without taking an entire day. You will be asked to explain any places where your solution does not match the spec.  Please target modern browsers, do not use images, and bonus points for graceful degradation and legacy support solutions.  We wish to assess your CSS skills, so don't use a CSS Framework like Bootstrap or Foundation, they have their place, but this is not it. JQuery is not needed to complete this exercise, we would like to assess your Javascript skills without the use of this library.",
